- [HTML version](intro_with_figures.html)
- [PDF version](intro_with_figures.pdf)
- [Sleep Data (new_sleep.csv)](new_sleep.csv)

The `new_sleep.csv` data file was created with the following code:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

sleep <- msleep %>%
  filter(!is.na(sleep_rem)) %>%
  mutate(body_size = if_else(bodywt > median(bodywt), "Large", "Small"),
         vore = replace(vore, is.na(vore), "unknown")) %>%
  select(name, vore, conservation, sleep_total, sleep_rem, sleep_cycle, 
         awake, bodywt, body_size)

write_csv(sleep, "./TWS 2019 - Figures in R/new_sleep.csv")
```
